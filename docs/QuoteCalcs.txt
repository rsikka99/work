--------------------------------------------
Margin Calculation (Use 20%/0.20 as example)
--------------------------------------------
Applying a margin to a cost means that the price will be 20% profit and 80% cost. 
If the margin is a whole number as percent (20%), then we need to convert it to decimal form (20 / 100 = 0.2)

Cost / (1 - Margin) = Price
100 / (1 - 0.20) = 125
100 / (0.80) = 125

As you can see, a 20% margin on 100 is not the same as a 20% markup.

--------------------------------------
Figuring out which lease factor to use
--------------------------------------
We have a leasing schema and we know the quote is attached to a term which has multiple ranges.
Knowing the term allows us to take the total quote value to select the proper lease factor (lookup with lease range)

Once we know the lease factor the calculation is actually extremely simple.

Quote Total Value * Lease Factor = Monthly Payment 


-----------------
Quote Total Value
-----------------
So of course now you're asking how do we calculate the total quote value when leasing?

I'll define each calculation below and how it progresses.

Package Cost 				= (Device Cost + (Option Cost * Quantity))

Package Price 				= Package Cost / (1 - Package Margin)

Package Purchase Subtotal 	= Package Price * Quantity
Package Lease Subtotal 		= (Package Price - Package Residual) * Quantity
Package Total Residual 		= Package Residual * Quantity

Group Purchase Subtotal 	= SUM(Package Purchase Subtotal)

Note: This next calculation may not have the right calculation for pages, but this makes the most sense to me
Group Lease Subtotal 		= SUM(Package Lease Subtotal) + SUM( (Page Included Price * Page Included Quantity * Lease Term) )


Quote Purchase Subtotal 	= SUM(Group Purchase Subtotal)
Quote Lease Subtotal 		= SUM(Group Lease Subtotal)

Quote Value 				= Quote Lease Subtotal

Quote Monthly Subtotal 		= Quote Lease Subtotal * Lease Factor
