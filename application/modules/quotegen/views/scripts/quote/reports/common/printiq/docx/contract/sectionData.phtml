This Agreement commences when signed by both parties (or such later date as way may designate).  The Supplies and/or Services will apply to devices ("Devices") as identified on a signed equipment schedule ("Equipment Schedule") and/or an agreed upon asset list as updated from time to time ("Asset List"). The Devices may, as indicated on an applicable PRINTIQ Asset List, include items you already own ("Your Devices"), and as indicated on an applicable PRINTIQ PLUS Equipment Schedule may include Devices owned and supplied by us ("Our Devices"). You agree to pay us the amounts payable under the terms of this Agreement each period by the due date.  We may charge you a program set-up fee of $99.00 to cover documentation, investigation and originations costs.  If any amount payable to us is not paid when due, you will pay a late charge equal to: 1) the greater of ten (10) cents for each dollar overdue or twenty-six ($26.00) dollars; or 2) the highest lawful charges, if less.

Under PRINTIQ PLUS, you are entitled to make the Monthly Page Allowance Per Device indicated each month during the term of this Agreement for the Monthly Fixed Charge. If you make more than the allowed pages in any month on any B&W Only Device, you will pay us an additional amount equal to the number of excess pages made during such month on such Device multiplied by the B&W Only Device(s) Excess Per Page Charge.  If you make more than the allowed pages in any month on any B&W and Color Device, you will pay us an additional amount equal to the number of excess pages made during such month on such Device multiplied by the B&W and Color Device(s) Excess Per Page Charge.  Regardless of the number of pages made in any month, you will never pay less than the Monthly Fixed Charge.  We may limit the number of cartridges supplied each month for each piece of Equipment to two times the manufacturer\’s stated yield according to the number of pages made.

In such event, you agree that for the purpose of monthly billing, we will estimate your monthly meters and you will pay us based on that estimate.   We are not responsible for any claims or losses arising out of or related to the DCA.  Each new Device remotely identified by the DCA that is not one of Our Devices will be automatically considered deemed one of Your Devices unless we determine that the Device is non-serviceable or you elect to exclude the new Device from this Agreement.  To exclude a newly identified Device from coverage under this Agreement, you must provide email written notice(including e-mail) to us of such exclusion within then (10) days or our email notification to you by indentifying the newly identified Device.
