<p>If you printed every document on both sides of the page, you could use up to 50% less paper than you would by printing only on one side. You could further
    reduce your paper consumption by using a scanner to email documents instead of printing copies for distribution. The following charts show how many of your
    printing devices have duplex and/or scanning capabilities.</p>
