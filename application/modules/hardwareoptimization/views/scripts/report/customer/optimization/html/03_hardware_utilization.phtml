    Hardware Utilization and Capacity

<p>A good measure of the recommended maximum monthly page volume for a printing device is the manufacturer's stated yield of a single print cartridge. In
    essence, you should not have to change the same toner cartridge more than once per month.
    Using this definition of maximum monthly page volume, the total capacity of your printing fleet is the sum of the maximum page volumes for all of your
    printing devices. As a guide we suggest that company printing should range between 30 and 50% of maximum fleet capacity. The closer you are to printing at
    maximum capacity, the more return you are getting on your printing assets. Most find that they have more printing hardware than they need. The following
    chart displays your estimated monthly page volume compared to your maximum monthly page capacity.</p>

    Print Volume and Number of Printing Devices

<p>You currently have <strong><?php echo $optimization->getDevices()->allIncludedDeviceInstances->getCount(); ?></strong> networked printing devices that print
    an average of
    <strong><?php echo $this->formatPageVolume(($optimization->getDevices()->allIncludedDeviceInstances->getPageCounts()->getCombinedPageCount()->getMonthly() / $optimization->getDevices()->allIncludedDeviceInstances->getCount())); ?>
    </strong> pages each per month, for an average total monthly print volume of
    <strong><?php echo $this->formatPageVolume($optimization->getDevices()->allIncludedDeviceInstances->getPageCounts()->getCombinedPageCount()->getMonthly()); ?></strong> pages.
    Ideally, you should have the minimum amount of printing hardware required to meet your print demand while maintaining user productivity.</p>
