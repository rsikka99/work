<div class="h1">Next Steps</div>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Financial:</strong> Review your toner usage and costs, and whether you can switch any of your OEM toners to Office Depot’s compatible toners.</li>
    <li><strong>Environmental:</strong> Review how many pages you are printing on both sides of the paper, and consider how much you could decrease your environmental impact by printing more on both sides.</li>
    <li><strong>Hardware Usage:</strong> Review your devices to see where some of your page volumes could be shifted to other devices, and which devices could be replaced or removed from your fleet.</li>
    <li><strong>MPS:</strong> Consider a managed print program that will allow your printing devices to be remotely managed with a set cost per page, saving you time and money and allowing you to focus more on your business.</li>
</ol>
