<div class="h1">Your PrintIQ&reg; Smart Assessment</div>
<p>It can be a challenge to understand your printing needs, and there
	are many factors to consider: hardware functionality, supplies
	delivery, service, parts, maintenance kits, IT time spent supporting
	printers -- and the cost for all of this. This free PrintIQ Smart
	Assessment will allow you to make sense of your printing needs and
	costs. Office Depot can help you get your office print under control
	with our smart and flexible managed print services solutions.</p>
<br />
<div class="pheader">Score Card</div>

	across five categories on a scale of 1 to 10. A score of 1 indicates a
	low-efficiency or high-cost scenario. A score of 10 indicates a
	high-efficiency or low-cost scenario. Your results are below:</p>
