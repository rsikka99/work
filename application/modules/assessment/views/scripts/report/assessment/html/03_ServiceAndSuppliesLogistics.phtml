<div class="pheader">Printing Device Management Breakdown</div>
<p>Different types of printing devices are managed in different ways. Newer networked printers can be managed with remote monitoring software; leased
    multifunction devices are typically managed by the vendor who sold the machine; devices not connected to the network, such as inkjets and some older
    printers, are difficult to manage because you cannot monitor them with software.</p>

<p>Based on your questionnaire,
    <strong><?= $inkjetString; ?> of your printing is done on inkjet devices</strong>. We did not monitor inkjet machines
    that are not connected to the network, and on average, pages printed to inkjet printers cost three times more than pages printed to laser devices. Without
    being on the network, users also cannot share these devices. There are some instances where desktop printers are appropriate, for instance, if a single user
    requires confidential, high-convenience printing. We can help you consolidate desktop hardware where appropriate, and where desktop printing is required, we
    can help you select network-capable equipment so your desktop printing can be managed with the rest of your office print.

<p>Time spent dealing with multiple vendors could be better spent focusing on your core business tasks. <?= $this->companyName; ?> can bundle your

<div class="pheader">Number of Printing Device Models and Supply Types</div>
<p>Out of your
    <strong><?= $assessmentViewModel->getDevices()->allIncludedDeviceInstances->getCount(); ?></strong> networked printing devices, you have
    <strong><?= $assessmentViewModel->getNumberOfUniqueModels(); ?></strong> unique models. Each section of the chart below represents a single model
    type. We estimate that
    <strong><?= count($assessmentViewModel->getDevices()->leasedDeviceInstances->getDeviceInstances()); ?></strong> of your printing devices are leased machines, for
    which supplies are included in your contract. The
    <strong><?= count($assessmentViewModel->getDevices()->purchasedDeviceInstances->getDeviceInstances()); ?></strong> remaining machines
    consist of
    <strong><?= $assessmentViewModel->getNumberOfUniquePurchasedModels(); ?></strong> different models and use
    <strong><?= $assessmentViewModel->getNumberOfUniquePurchasedToners(); ?></strong> different supply types. If you hold two of each supply in
    inventory, you have an estimated
    <strong><?= $this->currency($assessmentViewModel->getCashHeldInInventory()); ?> in operating cash held in printer
        supplies inventory</strong> at any given time.</p>
<div class="center">
    <img src="<?= $theGraphs[3]; ?>" /> <!--  Giant pie chart -->
</div>
<p>By using printing devices with supplies in common, you can minimize the amount of operating cash held up in supplies inventory and the amount of storage space
    required. <?= $this->companyName; ?> can provide you with just-in-time supplies fulfillment, which can further reduce your inventory requirements and
    emergency supply orders.</p>
