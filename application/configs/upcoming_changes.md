Pending Changes
===============

Version 2.0.00 Beta 4
=====================
- Added new summary and settings view to the hardware optimization
- Changed the navigation bars around a bit
- Changed the format of flash messages/alerts
- Changed wording with some hardware optimization settings
- Fixed issues with device swaps not always showing up in the hardware optimization

Version 2.0.00 Beta 3
=====================
- Added minor visual improvements to the device summary page such as button widths
- Changed footer to now have a support email instead of lorem ipsum.
- Fixed hardware optimization - It no longer displays a $0.00 cost delta for functionality replacements
- Fixed hardware optimization - It will now automatically upgrade mono to mono mfp and color to color mfp if the cost savings is above the given threshold.

Version 2.0.00 Beta 2
=====================
- Changed PrintFleet 3.x imports to capture color capability and toner level data when they are generated using the report builder instead of SQL. 
- Fixed Cost Per Page calculations to display properly when analyzing a fleet. Previously when a device was marked managed it would take on an existing cost per page instead of calculating it. Now if you are looking at the managed devices in a gross margin/optimization situation it calculates the cost per page but if you are running an assessment for the customer it uses the existing cost per page. This should help reflect more accurate costs throughout the system.
- Fixed layouts so that pages can be full width when needed
- Fixed select client on the dashboard

Version 2.0.00 Beta 1
=====================

- Changed HTML reports - In some cases we use the full width of the screen
- Changed look and feel to match new brand
